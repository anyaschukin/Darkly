## PAGE REDIRECT

Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the 
web application to redirect towards untrusted input.

# Use:
By modifying unsecured redirect URLs to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

# Prevention
- Sanitize input by creating a list of trusted URLs.
- Validate redirect requests (wherever possible you should use a built-in library or function to parse the URLs).
