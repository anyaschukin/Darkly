## PATH TRAVERSAL

Directory traversal is a navigation technique that can be used gain unauthorized access to the file system.
It's also known as the ../ (dot dot slash) attack, directory climbing, and backtracking. 

# Use:

If your site is indexed on Google, and you have URLs that pass file names in the query string, 
you are likely advertising a potential vulnerability to attackers.

A successful directory traversal attack can be used to gain access to:
- passwords, user and admin info, etc. 

# Prevention: 
- avoid passing around raw file paths. 
- Consider using indirection to label your files. Each time a file is uploaded, construct a “friendly” name for this on your site, 
and when the file is accessed, perform a lookup in your data-store to discover the actual file path.
- It is a good practice to run your server processes with only the permissions 
that they require to function (the principle of least privilege). 

## 42 EXAMPLE

page: http://192.168.0.16/?page=signin


# "?page=" is a open gate to the server
# Remove "signin" and add "/etc/passwd"
# Keep adding '../' after "?page=" to see if you reach a file system
# And...   http://192.168.0.16/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd is the winner!
