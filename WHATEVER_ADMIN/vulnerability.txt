# WHATEVER ADMIN

page : http://192.168.0.16

# Add /whatever to the home url
So http://192.168.0.16/whatever/

# This page contains a folder called htpasswd, which contains a file. 
Inside the file is...
root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3

md5_decrypt(8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3) = dragon

Now go to http://192.168.0.16/admin, username: root, password: dragon

The flag is : d19b4823e0d5600ceed56d5e896ef328d7a2b9e7ac7e80f4fcdb9b10bcb3e7ff 

md5_decrypt() at https://md5decrypt.net/

# Prevention
Priveleges to the htpasswd file should only be granted to admins, rather than anyone who simply adds '/whatever' to the home url.
