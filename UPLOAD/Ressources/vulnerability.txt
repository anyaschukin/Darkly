## UPLOAD

http://192.168.0.15/index.php?page=upload

Upload page rejects files which are not .jpg
However filetype is only checked against Content-Type field in request, not the file itself

find_flag.sh uploads a .txt file labeled as a .jpg

# Use
Allows upload of malicious code

# Prevention
Don't trust the user-defined Content-Type. Validate the file type independently, e.g. check magic numbers
