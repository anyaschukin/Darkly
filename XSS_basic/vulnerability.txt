Uncaught ReferenceError: mtxMessage is not defined
    validate_form http://192.168.0.16/index.php?page=feedback:57
    onsubmit http://192.168.0.16/index.php?page=feedback:1

# This only works with certain single letters (aceilprst) used in either the name or message. 
# These letters are an anagram of 'particles'

Include a function which handles edge cases in text input. 

Most modern frameworks natively handle this kind of vulnerability (like React, Vue, Angular Symfony)
