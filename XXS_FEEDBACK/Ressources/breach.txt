## XXS - CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

# In 'Name' and 'Message', type 'a' as name and 'b' as message.

... the following message shows up in the inspector console:

Uncaught ReferenceError: mtxMessage is not defined
    validate_form http://192.168.0.16/index.php?page=feedback:57
    onsubmit http://192.168.0.16/index.php?page=feedback:1

... the following flag appears:

flag = 0fbb54bbf7d099713ca4be297e1bc7da0173d8b3c21c1811b916a3a86652724e


# ALTERNATIVELY

# In the inspector console, find the following:
<textarea name="mtxtMessage" cols="50" rows="3" maxlength="50"></textarea>

# Erase the maxlength attribute, fill the form with HTML code, and hit submit.

... and the flag will appear!

# Prevention

Include a function which handles special characters, or converts HTML code. 

Most modern frameworks natively handle this kind of vulnerability (like React, Vue, Angular Symfony)
